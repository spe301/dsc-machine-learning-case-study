My assignment was to predict customer churn for a company. Because this was a classification task, classifying between churn and not churn, I decided to do a gridsearch on the
Logistic Regression, K nearest neighbors, and Gaussian Naive Bayes Scikitlearn models. Initially, my results were pretty bad

the best model I could get was with Gaussian Naive Bayes.
